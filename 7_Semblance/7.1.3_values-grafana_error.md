# Error found while adding grafana dashboard volumes

`values-grafana.yaml` was updated to include this block:

```
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: grafana-dashboards-provisioning
     mountPath: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards
 extraVolumes:
   - name: grafana-dashboards-provisioning
     configMap:
       name: grafana-dashboards-provisioning
```

This produced the following error:

```
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: 1 error occurred:
        * Deployment.apps "grafana" is invalid: spec.template.spec.initContainers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: "grafana-storage"
