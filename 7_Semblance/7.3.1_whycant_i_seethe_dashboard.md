It looks like you've provided a Helm values file for deploying Grafana. Here are a few things to check to troubleshoot why you can't see the dashboard:

1. **Service Type and Port**:
   - Ensure that the service type and port are correctly configured. You have `type: NodePort` and `port: 3000`. Make sure you are accessing Grafana using the correct Node IP and port (e.g., `http://<NodeIP>:30000`).

2. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Verify that the persistent storage is correctly mounted and accessible. The `initContainers` section is setting permissions, but ensure that the volume is correctly mounted and writable.

3. **ConfigMap for Dashboards**:
   - Check if the `grafana-dashboard-config` ConfigMap is correctly created and contains the necessary dashboard configurations. Ensure that the ConfigMap name matches the one specified in the values file.

4. **Pod Status**:
   - Check the status of the Grafana pods using `kubectl get pods`. Ensure that the pods are running without errors. If there are errors, describe the pod using `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to get more details.

5. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs of the Grafana pod using `kubectl logs <pod-name>`. Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate what went wrong.

6. **Network Policies**:
   - Ensure there are no network policies blocking access to the Grafana service.

If you've checked all these and still can't see the dashboard, please provide more details about any error messages or issues you're encountering, and I'll be happy to help further!

prompt: grafana ui loads but there is not dashboard


Got it! If the Grafana UI loads but you don't see any dashboards, here are a few things to check:

1. **Dashboard Provisioning**:
   - Ensure that the dashboards are correctly provisioned. Check the `grafana-dashboard-config` ConfigMap to make sure it contains the correct dashboard JSON files.

2. **ConfigMap Mounting**:
   - Verify that the ConfigMap is correctly mounted to the Grafana pod. You can check this by describing the pod and looking at the volume mounts:
     ```sh
     kubectl describe pod <grafana-pod-name>
     ```

3. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the permissions are correctly set for the mounted directories. The `initContainers` section should handle this, but double-check that the permissions are correct.

4. **Grafana Logs**:
   - Check the Grafana logs for any errors related to dashboard loading:
     ```sh
     kubectl logs <grafana-pod-name>
     ```

5. **Dashboard Configuration**:
   - Make sure that the dashboard configuration files are correctly formatted and valid JSON. Any errors in the JSON files can prevent the dashboards from loading.

6. **Grafana Configuration**:
   - Verify that the Grafana configuration includes the correct paths for provisioning dashboards. This is usually specified in the `grafana.ini` file or through environment variables.

If you've checked all these and still don't see the dashboards, please share any error messages or logs you find, and I'll help you troubleshoot further!

reason 1: bitnami template not used well with the main properties
reason 2: the volume stores data and volumeMount relates to the container not setup properly
